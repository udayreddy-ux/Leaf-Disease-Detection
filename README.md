# Leaf-Disease-Detection
Using deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks)
# Abstract
Leaf Disease Detection can be a helpful aspect on huge area of field of crops. In our country most of the people in many countries are dependent on the agricultural productivity. This project is also conveyed us by knowing artificial intelligence is helpful in solving real life problems. This project gives us the way to find the disease caused to the leaf by using CNN algorithm and another some classification algorithms and methods. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it requires a large amount of work of monitoring in big farm of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects symptoms of diseases means where they appear on plant leaves. In order to detect the disease some steps are to be followed using image processing. Detection of leaf disease will help to farmers and as well as society in Improving the quality and production of agricultural crops. This also makes the development of artificial intelligence technology in solving real life problems in model of machine level.
